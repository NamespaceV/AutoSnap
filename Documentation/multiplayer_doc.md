# Multiplayer Doc 

## Why it's doable
Player base at the start will be pretty hardcore, so asking players to setup a hamachi/other means
to ease making multiplayer work on devlopers part makes it possible.



## What we need -> don't need

we don't care about cheating -> tools to avoid desync? may even help with that





## ideas to scale

Main Server acting only as a list of currently hosted games, on players PC
server would only need hosted game owner IP + game settings




# TODO


## basic_start

input_manager -> grid_input_listener()
